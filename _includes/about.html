                <p>In the field of life sciences, obtaining information on biological processes at different scales is crucial for making new discoveries. 
                  Fluorescence microscopy has made significant progress in this area, but it has limitations such as a reliance on fluorescent labels and limitations in high-speed and long-term imaging. 
                  Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) has emerged as a promising solution, allowing for the combination of multicolor labeling and multi-resolution contextual investigation in the same area of interest. 
                  However, there are still many methodological issues to be addressed, such as the need for more effective sample preparation and dedicated instruments.
